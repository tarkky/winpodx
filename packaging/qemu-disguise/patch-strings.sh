# winpodx bare-metal disguise (#246) — QEMU source string patch.
#
# Rewrites the VM-identifying *strings* that winpodx CANNOT reach via QEMU
# command-line args, so the guest's ACPI OEM IDs and disk model stop reporting
# "BOCHS" / "QEMU HARDDISK". Run against an unpacked QEMU source tree before
# `configure && make`. It is string-replacement only (sed), so it is robust
# across QEMU minor versions — no fragile context-diff to re-port.
#
# The replacement values come from the HOST (so the guest reports your real
# machine, not a fixed brand) via these env vars, set by `winpodx disguise
# build-image`; each falls back to a generic-but-real default when the host
# value is unavailable:
#   ACPI_OEM6   6-byte ACPI OEM ID            (host bios/sys vendor)   ["ALASKA"]
#   ACPI_OEM8   8-byte ACPI OEM table ID      (host vendor, padded)    ["A M I   "]
#   DISK_MODEL  ATA/SCSI disk model string    (host /sys block model)  ["Samsung SSD 860"]
#   DVD_MODEL   optical model string                                   ["ASUS  DRW-24"]
#
# DELIBERATELY NOT INCLUDED: PCI vendor IDs (0x1AF4/0x1B36 -> 0x8086). Spoofing
# those breaks the Windows virtio driver binding — including dockur's own
# virtio-serial channel — so the guest won't boot. SMBIOS / CPUID are handled
# by winpodx via `-smbios` args + `-cpu kvm=off` (per-VM, no recompile).
#
# Signature-level VM hiding for VM-hostile apps / malware-analysis sandboxes.
# It does NOT defeat kernel anti-cheat (TPM attestation + RDTSC timing untouched).
