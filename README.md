> ### Status: Beta
>
> WinPodX is in active development (**v0.10.4**). Highlights of the recent releases:
>
> - **Bare-metal disguise** (0.7.0, opt-in): the guest reads like a physical machine to VM-detection software, al-khaser 0.82-verified
> - **Auto file associations + app management** (0.7.1): discovered apps appear in "Open with…", and the GUI gains hide/remove/restore
> - **Quick app launcher** (0.7.1): `winpodx launch` — a Start-menu-style picker bindable to a hotkey
> - **URL-scheme links** (0.9.0): `mailto:` / app schemes from Linux route to the right Windows app
> - **Reverse-open on the VM itself** (0.7.3): the guest `C:` is shared so a host app edits the real guest file
>
> The full history is in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

**No full-screen RDP.** Each Windows app becomes its own Linux window with its real icon — pinnable, alt-tabbable, file-associated, both directions. Drop into a full Windows desktop only when you actually want one (`winpodx app run desktop`).

WinPodX runs a Windows container (via [dockur/windows](https://github.com/dockur/windows)) in the background and presents Windows apps as native Linux applications through FreeRDP RemoteApp, while a bearer-authed HTTP agent inside the guest handles the host→guest command channel without flashing a PowerShell window. The reverse direction — Linux apps surfaced in the Windows "Open with…" menu — is handled by a host-side listener that consumes JSON requests written by per-slug Rust shims inside the guest. **Near-zero external Python dependencies** (stdlib only on Python 3.11+; one pure-Python `tomli` fallback on 3.9/3.10).

## Minimum requirements

**Before installing**, make sure your machine actually supports virtualisation. WinPodX runs Windows in a KVM-backed container; without these three, the install will run to completion but Windows will never boot.

| Requirement | How to check | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Intel VT-x or AMD-V enabled in BIOS / UEFI** | `lscpu \| grep -i virtualization` shows `VT-x` or `AMD-V` | Reboot → firmware setup → enable "Intel Virtualization Technology" / "SVM Mode" / "VT-x". OFF by default on many laptops. |
| **kvm kernel module loaded** | `lsmod \| grep kvm` lists `kvm_intel` or `kvm_amd` | `sudo modprobe kvm_intel` (Intel) or `sudo modprobe kvm_amd` (AMD). Auto-loads on next boot once BIOS allows it. |
| **Your user is in the `kvm` group** | `id -nG \| tr ' ' '\n' \| grep kvm` returns `kvm` | `sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER`, then log out + back in. |

Hardware: x86_64 or aarch64 CPU with virtualisation extensions, 8 GB+ RAM (12 GB+ recommended), and enough free disk for the configured Windows disk (64 GB by default) plus the install ISO. `install.sh` aborts with the same diagnostic if `/dev/kvm` is missing after the package install step — most "install ran fine but Windows never boots" bug reports trace back to one of the rows above. Rootless Podman also needs standalone `podman-compose` and entries for your user in `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid`; `winpodx setup-host` checks and fixes the group/subid host setup.

## Quick install

One-liner (any supported Linux distro):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kernalix7/winpodx/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or via a native package manager:

```bash
# openSUSE Tumbleweed / Leap / Slowroll
sudo zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/Kernalix7/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/home:Kernalix7.repo
sudo zypper install winpodx

# Fedora 42 / 43 / 44 (dnf5 — Fedora 41+)
sudo dnf config-manager addrepo --from-repofile=https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/Kernalix7/Fedora_43/home:Kernalix7.repo
sudo dnf install winpodx

# Debian / Ubuntu — grab the matching .deb from the latest release
sudo apt install ./winpodx_<version>_all_debian13.deb

# AlmaLinux / Rocky / RHEL 9 / 10 — grab the matching .rpm
sudo dnf install ./winpodx-<version>-0.noarch.el10.rpm

# Arch
yay -S winpodx

# Nix
nix run github:kernalix7/winpodx

# AppImage (distro-agnostic x86_64, single file)
# Download winpodx-x86_64.AppImage from the latest GitHub release
chmod +x winpodx-x86_64.AppImage
./winpodx-x86_64.AppImage setup
```

> **After a package-manager / AppImage install:** run `winpodx setup` once to generate `~/.config/winpodx/winpodx.toml` + compose.yaml and complete first provisioning. The curl one-liner does this for you; package installs ship the binary only so `apt install` / `dnf install` / `yay -S` / first AppImage launch don't trigger a long Windows ISO download out of the blue. After setup, launch an app with `winpodx app run desktop`.
>
> The Thin AppImage (0.6.0) bundles Python + Qt + winpodx + FreeRDP only — the container runtime lives on the host (`podman` ≥ 4 recommended, `docker` also supported) so the AppImage no longer fights a host stack you already have (#357, #363). Pre-0.6.0 fat AppImages bundled the whole podman stack and shadowed the host's. Host-side requirements left: a container runtime via your package manager, `/dev/kvm`, `kvm` group membership, and `/etc/subuid` / `/etc/subgid` for rootless Podman. `winpodx setup-host` fixes the kvm / subuid bits via a single `pkexec` prompt; `winpodx doctor` surfaces anything still missing.
>
> **Updating.** Re-run the same one-liner to pick up the latest release — it detects the existing install and upgrades it in place, keeping your config and Windows VM; a running tray / GUI restarts itself so the new version takes effect. This works unmodified on Bazzite and other rpm-ostree hosts too (no `--main`, no VM wipe). Installed via a package manager or the AppImage instead? Update it the same way you installed it — through your package manager, or by grabbing the newer `.deb` / `.rpm` / AppImage from the [latest release](https://github.com/kernalix7/winpodx/releases/latest).

See [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for offline / air-gapped builds, source installs, version pinning, updating, and uninstall.

## First-time setup

If you used the `curl install.sh` one-liner, setup and first provisioning already ran -- skip to [Launch](#launch). For every other install path (package managers, AppImage, source, wheel) run setup once before the first app launch:

```bash
# Auto setup -- host-detected defaults, no prompts
winpodx setup

# Interactive wizard -- pick backend, cores, RAM, edition, language, timezone, debloat preset
winpodx setup --customize
```

Setup writes `~/.config/winpodx/winpodx.toml` + `compose.yaml`, registers the GUI launcher, and confirms the host has FreeRDP + Podman / Docker + KVM. If any of those are missing, the output ends with a per-distro install command (e.g. `sudo apt install xfreerdp3 podman podman-compose` on Debian / Ubuntu, `sudo dnf install ...` on Fedora) -- run it and re-run `winpodx setup`.

Setup provisions the pod, pulls the dockur image, runs the Windows ISO download + Sysprep + OEM apply, then applies guest fixes, discovers apps, and configures reverse-open. `winpodx pod wait-ready --logs` is available to tail container progress when you start or recover the pod separately:

```bash
winpodx app run desktop          # Launch after setup; subsequent launches are near-instant
winpodx pod wait-ready --logs    # Optional: watch a separate cold-start/recovery live
```

Run `winpodx doctor` any time afterwards to re-check host state and surface the next fix command if something drifts:

```bash
winpodx doctor                   # Read-only -- prints what would need fixing
winpodx guest apply-fixes        # Re-applies guest-side runtime fixes (RDP timeouts, NIC power-save, etc.)
```

## Launch

```bash
winpodx app run word              # Launch Word
winpodx app run word ~/doc.docx   # Open a file
winpodx app run desktop           # Full Windows desktop
winpodx launch                    # Quick app launcher (Start-menu style picker)
```

Or just click an app icon in your application menu. `winpodx launch` opens a searchable picker of your Windows apps — bind it to a desktop-environment custom shortcut (KDE: *System Settings → Shortcuts → Custom*; GNOME: *Settings → Keyboard → Custom Shortcuts*) for a system-wide hotkey. See [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md) for the full CLI, the Qt6 GUI, health checks, and configuration.

## Key features

<table>
<tr><td colspan="2">

**Bare-metal disguise (VM-detection avoidance)** — opt-in, off by default
- Makes the Windows guest read as a **physical machine** to software that refuses to run under a detected hypervisor — Nvidia GPU-passthrough "code 43", launch-gate VM checks, VM-hostile installers
- `pod.disguise_level balanced | max`: **balanced** hides the CPUID hypervisor bit + KVM signature and mirrors the host's real SMBIOS/DMI; **max** ("Hardened") adds a locally-built patched-QEMU image (`winpodx disguise build-image`) that rewrites the ACPI / disk / sensor / USB fingerprints and drops the virtio + Red-Hat PCI tells (keeps USB3)
- Host-derived strings stay in the **local image only** (never committed to git); serial / UUID / asset-tag are never read
- **al-khaser 0.82-verified** — enable with `winpodx config set pod.disguise_level max` or the GUI Settings "Bare-metal" selector
- [Details →](docs/FEATURES.md#bare-metal-disguise-vm-detection-avoidance)

</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">

**Reverse-open**
- Linux apps appear in the Windows guest's right-click "Open with…" menu by default
- Correct per-app icons in both the short menu and the long "Choose another app" dialog
- Selecting one round-trips the file open to host `xdg-open`
- Auto-discovers host-side Linux apps + their MIME associations from freedesktop standards
- Manage via `winpodx host-open` CLI or the GUI Settings panel
- [Details →](docs/FEATURES.md#reverse-open-linux-apps-in-windows-open-with)

</td><td width="50%">

**Seamless app windows**
- RemoteApp (RAIL) renders each Windows app as a native Linux window — no full desktop
- Per-app taskbar icons via `WM_CLASS` matching (`/wm-class:<stem>` + `StartupWMClass`)
- Bidirectional file associations: double-click `.docx` in your file manager → Word opens
- Multi-session RDP: bundled [rdprrap](https://github.com/kernalix7/rdprrap) auto-enables up to 25 independent sessions by default (configurable from 1 to 50)
- Multi-monitor RAIL: a remote-app window keeps working input when dragged onto a second monitor — on by default (`cfg.rdp.multimon`, default `span`)
- RAIL prerequisites set automatically during unattended install

</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">

**Zero-config launch**
- First app click auto-provisions everything: config, container, desktop entries
- Auto-discovery during first provisioning registers Start-Menu-visible Win32 and UWP/MSIX apps with their real icons; `desktop.full_app_scan = true` also scans Registry App Paths and Chocolatey/Scoop shims
- Manual rescan any time via `winpodx app refresh` or the GUI Refresh button
- Multi-backend: Podman (default), Docker, manual RDP (the libvirt backend was dropped in 0.6.0 — stay on ≤0.5.x or use the manual backend for your own libvirt domain)

</td><td width="50%">

**Peripherals & sharing**
- **Clipboard**: bidirectional copy-paste (text + images) — on by default
- **Sound**: RDP audio streaming (`/sound:sys:alsa`) — on by default
- **Printer**: Linux printers shared to Windows — on by default
- **Home directory**: shared as `\\tsclient\home`
- **USB drives**: removable media is shared at `\\tsclient\media\<LABEL>`; the USB desktop shortcut always resolves, opening an empty folder when nothing is mounted instead of erroring. Raw devices use USB passthrough and receive their own Windows drive letter
- **Host USB / PCI device passthrough**: pass real host devices into the Windows guest — `winpodx device list / attach <id> / detach <id>`, a GUI "Devices" tab (two-column host↔guest mover), and a system-tray USB switcher. USB hot-plugs live (`cfg.pod.usb_live`, default on); PCI is boot-added and needs a guest restart plus a `--force` / dialog confirmation

</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%">

**Automation & security**
- Auto suspend / resume: container pauses when idle, resumes on next launch
- Pod auto-start on login (opt-in): `winpodx autostart on` installs a tray autostart entry so the pod starts/resumes at login — off by default (`autostart off|status`, or a GUI Settings checkbox)
- UNRESPONSIVE → recover: a stalled RDP guest is detected on `RUNNING → UNRESPONSIVE` and self-healed via an in-guest TermService cycle, no `pod restart` needed
- Host-adaptive Windows-on-KVM tuning profile: `+invtsc`, `platform_tick` and more, gated by host capability — `tuning_profile = auto|safe|off`
- Password auto-rotation: 20-char cryptographic password, 7-day cycle with atomic rollback
- Smart DPI scaling: auto-detects from GNOME, KDE, Sway, Hyprland, Cinnamon, xrdb
- Windows debloat: telemetry, ads, Cortana, search indexing disabled by default
- FreeRDP `extra_flags` allowlist (regex-validated) as the user-input safety boundary
- Time sync: force Windows clock resync after host sleep/wake

</td><td width="50%">

**Operations & resilience**
- Multilingual UI: tray / GUI / CLI fully translated to 7 languages (en / ko / zh / ja / de / fr / it), auto-detected from `$LANG` — override with `winpodx language <code>` or GUI Settings → "WinPodX UI language"
- Windows disk auto-grow: C: grows itself when it fills past a threshold while idle, bounded by host free space — or grow on demand (`winpodx install grow-disk [SIZE]`, `winpodx install disk-usage`, GUI Tools → Grow Disk)
- Guest sync: push updated agent / urlacl / rdprrap / fixes into a running guest after a host upgrade — automatic once per pod start, or `winpodx guest sync [--force]`
- Offline / air-gapped install (`--source` + `--image-tar`)
- One-line uninstall (keeps Windows VM data unless `--purge`)
- Health checks via `winpodx doctor` (deps / pod / RDP / agent / disk / round-trip / password age; `--json` for machine-readable, `--quick` for cheap subset, `--fix` for idempotent auto-remediation of common findings)
- Redesigned Qt6 GUI: a left Start-menu-style navigation sidebar + a **Dashboard** home with live Pod / RAM / CPU ring gauges, disk usage, an auto-recovery status card, pinned/recent workspace tiles, and a reverse-open toggle; the app launcher is the "Applications" page, alongside Devices / Settings / Tools / Terminal / Info — plus a lighter system tray. In-house SVG icon set, responsive reflow, and a hero search that doubles as a command bar
- Stdlib-leaning Python (no pip-deps on 3.11+; one `tomli` fallback on 3.9 / 3.10)
