# Usage

**English** | [한국어](USAGE.ko.md)

CLI, GUI, configuration, and health checks. Everything you need after install.

## Launch an app

```bash
winpodx app run word              # Launch Word
winpodx app run word ~/doc.docx   # Open a file
winpodx app run desktop           # Full Windows desktop
```

Or just click an app icon in your application menu — WinPodX registers every discovered Windows app as a `.desktop` entry the first time the pod boots.

## Qt6 GUI tour

Launch with `winpodx gui`. The Qt6 desktop app uses a Windows 11 Settings-style NavigationView with Fluent light and dark styling. It follows the system color scheme; set `WINPODX_COLOR_SCHEME=light` or `WINPODX_COLOR_SCHEME=dark` before launch to override it for that process. The font order is Segoe UI Variable, Segoe UI, bundled Selawik, then the desktop default. Selawik ships with WinPodX, so it needs no system font package.

At normal widths the navigation pane is 320 px wide. Below 1100 px it collapses to a 48 px icon rail. Use the hamburger button to expand it; the expanded pane overlays the page and closes when you select a page or click outside it. The custom title bar provides minimize, maximize, close, drag, and double-click maximize. Set `WINPODX_NATIVE_TITLEBAR=1` before launch to use the window manager's native decorations instead.

The pages are:

| Page | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| **Dashboard** | Pod-state hero with Start and Stop, RAM, CPU, and disk rings, quick actions, running apps, pinned tiles, and a reverse-open toggle |
| **Applications** | Start Menu app tiles with category counts, search, grid or list display, and context actions |
| **Settings** | SettingsCard groups for RDP Connection, Hardware, Windows Update, Integration, Localization, and Danger zone; the header Save button gains a dirty dot after edits |
| **Tools** | Pod Management and system action rows, disabled with an explanation while the pod is stopped, plus RDP Sessions |
| **Terminal / Logs** | Command and log view with the existing safe command controls |
| **Info** | About, Copy diagnostics, and Health |
| **Devices** | USB and PCI groups with totals for discovered and assigned devices, filtering, and a risky-PCI flag; PCI changes still need a guest restart and confirmation |
| **License** | License text and acknowledgements |

`winpodx launch` opens a compact Start-style flyout for Windows apps. The system tray (`winpodx tray`) remains the lighter-weight alternative for pod controls, the current app launcher, USB switching, maintenance, and running RDP sessions.

### Tray auto-spawn + UNRESPONSIVE recovery (v0.5.5)

Since v0.5.5 the tray spawns itself automatically from the GUI window and from CLI subcommands (except `setup` / `gui` / `launch` / `tray`), so a user who only ever runs `winpodx app run` still gets the system-tray indicator + the UNRESPONSIVE auto-recovery driver. A flock under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/winpodx/tray.lock` prevents stacked instances when the user manually re-launches the tray.

The tray context menu now starts with **Open Dashboard** (one-click to the main GUI window). **Quit** confirms via a dialog and on confirmation runs `stop_pod` + `pkill -f 'winpodx gui'` + `app.quit` so a stray click can't cycle the pod's ~30 s restart.

To launch the tray at every login, open the GUI → Settings → tick **"Launch WinPodX tray at login (system tray icon + idle-stall auto-recovery)"**. The toggle writes / removes `~/.config/autostart/winpodx-tray.desktop` via the XDG autostart spec; portable across KDE / GNOME / XFCE / Cinnamon. The file is the source of truth — you can also drop it by hand to opt out without launching the GUI. Toggle applies immediately; no Save Settings click needed.

The tray watches the pod state every 30 s. On a `RUNNING → UNRESPONSIVE` transition (container alive long enough that an RDP-port miss can't be confused with a fresh boot) it fires a desktop notification and spawns a background worker that asks the agent to cycle Windows `TermService`. On recovery a "Pod recovered" notification fires; on failure a "needs manual restart" notification points at `winpodx pod restart`. While `install.sh` is running its `[3/4]` / `[4/4]` Sysprep + OEM-reboot phases, the marker file `~/.config/winpodx/.install_in_progress` suppresses the recovery path so genuine install-time RDP gaps don't fire spurious notifications.

## Host device passthrough

Pass a host USB or (non-GPU) PCI device through to the Windows guest (#286). Three surfaces drive the same backend:

* **CLI** — `winpodx device list` shows each host device + its attach state; `winpodx device attach <id>` / `winpodx device detach <id>` move one in or out.
* **GUI Devices page** — USB and PCI device groups with filters, assignment state, and attach or detach actions.
* **System tray** — a USB switcher submenu (#300) for one-click attach / detach of host USB devices.

USB devices redirect live through usbredir — no restart needed, and a privilege prompt may appear so the host helper can open the device. A PCI device is boot-added and only becomes visible after a guest restart, so the attach is guarded by a safety confirmation; pass `--force` on the CLI (or confirm the dialog in the GUI) to proceed. The legacy `pod.usb_live` key is still accepted but no longer gates usbredir.

## Bare-metal compatibility mode (hide the hypervisor)

Some software refuses to run under a detected hypervisor — most notably Nvidia's consumer GPU drivers (they fault with **code 43** when they see KVM, the common GPU-passthrough blocker) and apps with launch-gate VM checks. `cfg.pod.disguise_level` (#246) hides the KVM/QEMU signature from the guest so it presents as a physical PC. It has **three levels, default `balanced`**:

| Level | What it does | Performance |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| `off` | No disguise — an honest VM. | Best (and most compatible) |
| `balanced` (default) | Clears the CPUID hypervisor bit + KVM signature, mirrors the host's SMBIOS/DMI, adds synthetic sensor descriptors, and advertises a bare-metal-looking disk size. | No measurable cost |
| `max` | Everything in `balanced` **plus** emulated virtual hardware — disk → SATA (AHCI), network → e1000 (`MTU=1500`), GPU → std VGA, no virtio-rng — and `HV=N`. This removes the virtio (`VEN_1AF4`) / QXL (`VEN_1B36`) PCI IDs and the `vioscsi`/`viostor`/`netkvm` drivers that give a KVM guest away. (`MTU=1500` is required so dockur omits the `host_mtu=` flag that an e1000 NIC rejects.) **Requires a wipe + reinstall** (changing the boot-disk controller makes the existing install unbootable), so switching into/out of `max` prompts a strong confirmation and reinstalls Windows from scratch. | **Significantly slower** — emulated disk + NIC have much lower throughput than virtio, and Hyper-V enlightenments are off |

```bash
winpodx config set pod.disguise_level off        # honest VM
winpodx config set pod.disguise_level balanced   # default — free hiding, auto-applies a container recreate
winpodx config set pod.disguise_level max        # maximum hiding (emulated HW, slower; saved but not auto-applied)
# off <-> balanced auto-apply a container recreate. Switching into/out of `max` changes the
# virtual hardware, so it needs a destructive reinstall — apply it with:
winpodx pod recreate --wipe-storage              # WIPES Windows, reinstalls on the new hardware
```

You can also pick the level in the GUI: **Settings → Bare-metal compatibility**. Switching between `off` and `balanced` recreates the container while preserving the Windows disk; switching into or out of `max` rebuilds the virtual hardware and requires the destructive reinstall above.

**Advanced — patched-QEMU image (`winpodx disguise build-image`):** a couple of VM markers live in QEMU's compiled-in strings (ACPI OEM `BOCHS`, disk model `QEMU HARDDISK`) that command-line args can't reach. Run `winpodx disguise build-image` — it builds a custom dockur image whose QEMU has those strings patched to **your host's real vendor + disk model** (read from `/sys`, no root, nothing committed; ~20–40 min compile, local image only), then sets `cfg.pod.disguise_image` so `max` uses it. winpodx ships only the patch recipe (`packaging/qemu-disguise/`), never a patched binary. PCI vendor IDs are deliberately left alone (spoofing them breaks dockur's virtio-serial). See that directory's README.

**Not an anti-cheat bypass.** This is signature-level VM hiding for casual detectors and VM-hostile apps (code 43, DRM/launch gates). It does **not** defeat kernel-mode anti-cheat (EAC / BattlEye / Vanguard) — those anchor on hardware attestation (TPM + Secure Boot) and VM-exit timing the guest can't spoof — and bypassing online-game anti-cheat violates the game's ToS.

The disk bump is gated: the dockur disk is sparse, so a larger advertised size costs ~0 host space up front, but winpodx only raises it when the host has enough free space for the target plus a 10 GiB reserve. On a small host it leaves the disk as-is and logs a warning. The legacy `disguise_hypervisor = false` key still works — it maps to `off`.

> **This is not an anti-cheat bypass.** It is signature-level only and does **not** defeat kernel-mode anti-cheat (EAC / BattlEye / Vanguard). Bypassing anti-cheat in online games violates their terms of service and risks a ban — winpodx does not support that use.

## Multi-monitor

Multi-monitor RAIL is on by default (`cfg.rdp.multimon`, default `"span"`): a remote-app window keeps working input when you drag it onto a second monitor. Values:

| `cfg.rdp.multimon` | Effect |
|---|---|
| `span` (default) | Span the RDP session across all monitors so a remote-app window stays interactive on any of them |
| `multimon` | Use FreeRDP's discrete `/multimon` mode (diagnostic only; currently breaks RAIL input with rdprrap) |
| `off` | Single-monitor only |

Change it with `winpodx config set rdp.multimon off` or via the GUI Settings page.

## Health checks

`winpodx doctor` checks the install source, dependencies, KVM / rootless setup, backend and ports, config / pending state, desktop entries, container health, guest agent, and OEM drift. It prints each finding with details and a suggested fix:

```
=== WinPodX doctor ===

  [OK]   FreeRDP available
  [OK]   KVM device available
  [OK]   compose provider available
  [OK]   container is healthy
  [OK]   guest agent /health responding
  [OK]   guest version current

Summary: all checks passed.
```

Status legend: `OK` / `WARN` (informational, exit 0) / `FAIL` (exit 1). Use `--json` for a machine-readable array of findings.

## Changing the Windows password

Use `winpodx rotate-password` — never reuse `winpodx setup` for this. The two have very different effects on an already-running install:

| Command | Host config (`winpodx.toml`) | Windows guest account |
|---|---|---|
| `winpodx rotate-password` | Updated atomically (with rollback on failure) | Updated via Windows-side change mechanism |
| `winpodx setup` (rerun) | Preserved as-is (since v0.5.5) | Not touched |
| `winpodx setup` (fresh install, no prior config) | Generated / prompted | Applied on first boot via dockur `USERNAME`/`PASSWORD` env vars |

Re-running `winpodx setup` to bump cores / RAM / `win_version` is safe and will not touch your credentials. On pre-v0.5.5 releases the wizard reprompted for the password every run and silently overwrote `winpodx.toml` — but dockur honors the password env var only on first boot, so the host config desynced from the Windows guest account and the next RDP launch failed with `LOGON_FAILED_BAD_PASSWORD`.

### Recovering from a desynced password (pre-v0.5.5 lockout)

If you ran `winpodx setup` on an older release and can no longer log in:

1. **Restore the old password** if you still have it (in a `winpodx.toml` backup, your password manager, or your shell history):
   ```bash
   winpodx config set rdp.password '<old-password>'
   winpodx pod start
   winpodx rotate-password
   ```
2. **Otherwise**, the only path is `winpodx uninstall --purge` + reinstall, which loses any in-Windows state (installed apps, documents, settings). Make a fresh `winpodx setup` your first step after reinstall, then never touch the password through `setup` again — use `rotate-password`.

## Performance tuning profile

`cfg.pod.tuning_profile` controls how aggressively WinPodX resolves Windows-on-KVM tuning for the underlying host. It defaults to `"auto"` — WinPodX probes the host at compose time, applies the supported CPU / nested-virtualization / entropy tweaks, and reports additional host-side recommendations. Look at the `[Tuning]` block in the deprecated `winpodx info` alias (or the GUI Info page) to see what was detected and resolved:

```
[Tuning]
  invtsc:        yes   (intel)
  io_uring:      yes   (kernel 6.18, need >= 5.6)
  hugepages:     no    (sysctl vm.nr_hugepages)
  dedicated:     yes
  nested_kvm:    yes   (/sys/module/kvm_*/parameters/nested)

  Profile: auto
    +invtsc:        yes
    io_uring aio:   yes
    hugepages:      no
    CPU pinning:    yes
    platform_tick:  yes
    no balloon:     yes
    hv-* + no-hpet: yes
    virtio-rng:     yes
    nested virt:    yes
    hv-evmcs:       yes
```

Profiles:

| `tuning_profile` | What it does |
|---|---|
| `auto` (default) | Detect host capability and resolve every safe tuning the host can support, including Hyper-V enlightenments, virtio-rng, and nested-virt pass-through when `/sys/module/kvm_*/parameters/nested` is set. CPU-pinning / no-balloon recommendations are gated on `dedicated_host` (idle CPU + free RAM ≥ 2× VM allocation) so we don't starve other host workloads. Recommended for most users. |
| `performance` | Same as `auto` but bypasses the `dedicated_host` gate in the resolved profile: CPU pinning + no-balloon are recommended regardless of current host load. Use when the box is mostly dedicated to WinPodX. Hard-gated knobs (`+invtsc`, `io_uring`) still respect capability detection. |
| `safe` | Apply the Windows-guest-only subset that requires no host configuration: `+invtsc` (when supported), `platform_tick` BCD tweak, Hyper-V enlightenments (`hv-relaxed`, `hv-vapic`, `hv-vpindex`, `hv-runtime`, `hv-synic`, `hv-reset`, `hv-frequencies`, `hv-reenlightenment`, `hv-tlbflush`, `hv-ipi`, `hv-spinlocks=0x1fff`, `hv-stimer`, `hv-stimer-direct`, `-no-hpet`), and `virtio-rng`. Excludes nested-virt + `hv-evmcs` which need explicit host-side opt-in. |
| `off` | Apply nothing; the dockur defaults stand. Use when troubleshooting suspected tuning interaction. |
| `manual` | Same shape as `safe`; reserved for future per-knob overrides. |

### What each tuning does

* **`+invtsc`** — exposes invariant TSC so Windows uses TSC as the clock source instead of HPET (lower IRQ overhead).
* **`hv-*` enlightenments + `-no-hpet`** (#245) — tells Windows it's running under a paravirtualised hypervisor. Cuts spinlock / VM-exit overhead on every workload; doubly noticeable on multi-vCPU guests. `hv-spinlocks=0x1fff` is the upstream-recommended retry budget.
* **`virtio-rng-pci` backed by `/dev/urandom`** (#245) — fills the Windows entropy pool quickly on first boot so CryptoAPI / TLS handshakes don't stall waiting for kernel randomness.
* **`+vmx` / `+svm` nested virt** (#245) — auto-enabled when `/sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested` or `kvm_amd` reads `Y`. Required for Hyper-V / WSL2 / Docker Desktop inside the Windows guest. No effect when the host kernel hasn't opted in.
* **`hv-evmcs`** (#245) — Intel-only nested-VMCS optimisation, paired with `+vmx`. Zero overhead when the guest doesn't run nested VMs.
* **`io_uring` AIO** — kernel ≥ 5.6 disk I/O backend; lower latency than legacy threads.
* **Hugepages** — backs the QEMU memory with 2 MB pages. Requires `vm.nr_hugepages` reserved on the host (WinPodX does not auto-reserve).
* **CPU pinning / no-balloon / hugepages / `io_uring`** — detected and shown in the resolved tuning profile, but not currently emitted into `compose.yaml`; apply host-side scheduling and memory setup yourself if desired.

### One-shot override

`winpodx pod start --tuning {auto,performance,safe,off,manual}` overrides `cfg.pod.tuning_profile` for the lifetime of that container run only. The user's persisted preference in `winpodx.toml` is left untouched. Useful for A/B testing — flip back and forth without `winpodx config set` round-trips.

### Items that require host-side setup (not auto-applied)

These are standard Windows-on-KVM tweaks that need operator action on the Linux host. The `[Tuning]` block in `winpodx info` reports their detected / resolved state.

* **Transparent hugepages / explicit hugepages.** Set `vm.nr_hugepages` via `sysctl` (or use `madvise` THP) if you want QEMU backed by hugepages. WinPodX reports `HugePages_Total > 0` in the tuning summary but does not currently emit a hugepages compose setting.
* **CPU pinning.** WinPodX flags the host as `dedicated` when the current idle CPU + RAM is at least twice the VM's allocation. Pinning the QEMU thread to specific cores via `taskset` (or systemd `CPUAffinity=`) is then up to the operator; WinPodX will not modify host scheduling.
* **VFIO GPU passthrough.** Out of scope for the RDP-based WinPodX architecture. (Non-GPU USB / PCI device passthrough *is* supported — see "Host device passthrough" below.) If you need bare-metal GPU performance, run your own GPU-passthrough Windows VM (for example with libvirt / virt-manager) and point WinPodX at its RDP endpoint using the `manual` backend.

Edit via `winpodx config set <key> <value>` or directly with your editor — TOML is parsed via the stdlib on Python 3.11+ (`tomli` on 3.10).

`rdp.media_drive_enabled` defaults to `true` for compatibility. Set it to `false` to omit FreeRDP's `/drive:media,...` mapping, preventing mounted host removable storage from appearing at `\\tsclient\media` in the guest. This does not change raw USB device passthrough.

Fresh aarch64 setups use the matching `ghcr.io/dockur/windows-arm@sha256:...` package. A non-empty `pod.image` is preserved across upgrades, including Docker Hub pins and private mirrors; run `winpodx setup --update-image` only when you explicitly want the latest official GHCR image.
