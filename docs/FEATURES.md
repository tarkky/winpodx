# Features

**English** | [한국어](FEATURES.ko.md)

The full feature set: peripherals & sharing, multi-session RDP, app profiles, and reverse-open (Linux apps in the Windows "Open with…" menu).

## Reverse-open (Linux apps in Windows "Open with…")

Shipped in v0.5.0, default-on since. Right-click any file inside the Windows guest and your Linux-side handler appears in the "Open with…" menu — Kate for `.txt`, gwenview for `.png`, Firefox for `.html`, and so on. Picking one round-trips the file open back to that discovered Linux app.

How it works:

```
Windows Explorer right-click  ─┐
                               │  per-slug winpodx-<slug>.exe
                               │  (Rust shim, icon embedded via rcedit)
                               ▼
   atomic JSON write to \\tsclient\home\.local\share\winpodx\reverse-open\incoming\<uuid>.json
                               │
                               ▼
   host listener daemon picks it up, safe_open_unc validates the path
                               │
                               ▼
   subprocess: <app.exec_argv> with the real host file path
```

The feature is **on by default** (`cfg.reverse_open.enabled = true`). Each Linux app the user has set as a Linux default handler — via `xdg-mime default` or their DE's "Default Applications" settings — is registered on the Windows side with the matching extensions. Discovery walks `$XDG_DATA_HOME/applications` + `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` plus every `mimeapps.list` in the freedesktop search path.

Manage via the CLI:

```bash
winpodx host-open status        # listener + manifest state
winpodx host-open list          # apps that would be pushed
winpodx host-open refresh       # rescan + push to guest
winpodx host-open add <slug>    # allowlist
winpodx host-open remove <slug> # remove (or --deny)
winpodx host-open disable       # turn the whole feature off
```

Or via the GUI Settings page → reverse-open panel (same controls).

Per-slug icons render in both the short Open With menu and the long "Choose another app" dialog because each `winpodx-<slug>.exe` is an independent copy of the Rust shim with the matching `.ico` embedded into its PE resource section (via vendored `rcedit.exe`, electron/rcedit v2.0.0, MIT). The chooser icon trade-off: the per-slug `.exe` copies cost ~500 KB × N apps on disk (no hard-link inode sharing) because that's the only chooser-icon path Win10/Win11 reliably honour.

## Seamless app windows

- RemoteApp (RAIL) renders each app as a native Linux window — no full desktop
- Per-app taskbar icons via `WM_CLASS` matching (`/wm-class:<stem>` + `StartupWMClass`)
- File associations: double-click `.docx` in your Linux file manager → Word opens
- Multi-session RDP: bundled rdprrap auto-enables independent sessions; `cfg.pod.max_sessions` defaults to 25 and is clamped to 1–50
- Terminate any running session from the GUI Tools page (RDP Sessions card) or the system-tray menu
- RAIL prerequisites (`fDisabledAllowList=1` + `fInheritInitialProgram=1` + `fSingleSessionPerUser=0` + configured `MaxInstanceCount`) are set automatically
- Multi-monitor RAIL on by default (`cfg.rdp.multimon = "span"`): a remote-app window keeps working input when dragged onto a second monitor
- UWP/Store apps now appear in the Linux taskbar like any other app

## Zero-config launch

- First app click auto-provisions everything: config, container, desktop entries
- Auto-discovery on first boot scans Start Menu shortcuts, Start-Menu-visible UWP/MSIX apps, and OS essentials with their real icons; set `desktop.full_app_scan = true` to add Registry App Paths, all UWP packages, Chocolatey, and Scoop
- Manual rescan any time via `winpodx app refresh` or the GUI Refresh button
- Interactive setup wizard for advanced configuration
- Optional pod auto-start on login (opt-in, off by default): `winpodx autostart on|off|status` or the GUI checkbox installs an XDG autostart `.desktop` entry (`~/.config/autostart/winpodx-tray.desktop`) so the tray launches on login and warms the Windows pod before your first app click

## Multilingual UI

The tray, GUI, and CLI are fully translated into 7 languages: English, Korean (한국어), Chinese (中文), Japanese (日本語), German (Deutsch), French (Français), and Italian (Italiano).

- Auto-detected from the system locale on first run; falls back to English when the locale isn't covered
- Switch any time with `winpodx language <code>` (e.g. `winpodx language ja`) or the GUI language dropdown
- Persisted in config under `[ui] language`

## Desktop app

The Qt6 desktop app is a Windows 11 Settings-style shell. Its navigation pane is 320 px wide, collapses to a 48 px icon rail below 1100 px, and opens as an overlay from the hamburger button when space is tight. Clicking outside an open overlay closes it. The custom title bar supports caption buttons, drag, and double-click maximize; set `WINPODX_NATIVE_TITLEBAR=1` to use native decorations. Light and dark mode follow the OS, or use `WINPODX_COLOR_SCHEME=light|dark` for a process override.

- **Dashboard** is the home page for pod state, Start and Stop, RAM, CPU, and disk rings, quick actions, running apps, pinned tiles, and reverse-open.
- **Applications** shows discovered Start Menu apps as searchable grid or list tiles with category counts and context actions.
- **Settings** groups RDP Connection, Hardware, Windows Update, Integration, Localization, and Danger zone. Its Save button carries a dirty dot until changes are saved.
- **Tools**, **Terminal / Logs**, **Info**, **Devices**, and **License** round out the shell. Devices groups USB and PCI entries, supports filtering, marks risky PCI assignments, and shows assignment counts.
- `winpodx launch` is a compact Start-style flyout. The in-house SVG icon set and bundled Selawik font avoid a system font dependency.

## Peripherals & Sharing

| Feature | How it works | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Clipboard** | Bidirectional copy-paste via RDP (`+clipboard`) | Enabled |
| **Sound** | Audio streaming via ALSA (`/sound:sys:alsa`) | Enabled |
| **Printer** | Linux printers shared to Windows (`/printer`) | Enabled |
| **Home directory** | Shared as `\\tsclient\home`: the whole Home via `+home-drive`, or only `pod.home_share` via `/drive:home,<path>` | Enabled |
| **USB drives** | Media folder shared as `\\tsclient\media` (`/drive:media`); USB drives plugged in after session start are accessible as subfolders. The guest-side USB shortcut always resolves even when no media is mounted | Enabled |
| **USB device passthrough** | Native USB redirection (`/usb:auto`) — requires FreeRDP urbdrc plugin | **Opt-in** (add to `extra_flags`) |
| **Host USB / PCI passthrough** | Map a host USB or PCI device straight into the Windows guest (`winpodx device list / attach / detach`, GUI Devices page, tray USB switcher). The GUI groups and filters USB and PCI devices, shows assignment state, and flags risky PCI changes. USB redirects live through usbredir; PCI is boot-added and needs a guest restart + safety confirmation | USB live |
| **Reverse file open** | Linux apps appear in the Windows guest's right-click "Open with…" menu; selecting one round-trips the file open to that discovered host app | Enabled |

### USB Drive Flow

```
Plug in USB on Linux
    │
    ▼
Linux mounts to /run/media/$USER/USBNAME
    │
    ▼
FreeRDP shares as \\tsclient\media\USBNAME
    │
    ▼
Windows Explorer opens it through the desktop USB shortcut
```

### Host USB / PCI device passthrough

Map a real host peripheral all the way into the Windows guest, not just a shared folder:

```bash
winpodx device list            # host devices + current guest attachment state
winpodx device attach <id>     # attach a USB or PCI device to the guest
winpodx device detach <id>     # detach it again
```

- **USB** redirects live through usbredir — attach/detach without restarting the guest; a privilege prompt may appear so the host helper can open the device. The legacy `pod.usb_live` key no longer gates this path.
- **PCI** is boot-added: it needs a guest restart to take effect and asks for a safety confirmation (`--force` on the CLI, or the dialog in the GUI).
- The **GUI Devices page** groups USB and PCI devices, shows assignment state and filtering, and the **system-tray USB switcher** lets you flip a USB device in or out without opening the full window.

**GPU acceleration:** not yet supported. dockur/windows runs under QEMU/KVM with software graphics — DirectX-heavy games and 3D apps will be CPU-bound. GPU passthrough via VFIO is feasible but not packaged. (See [COMPARISON.md](COMPARISON.md) → WinPodX vs Wine — Wine + DXVK is the right tool when you need GPU.)

## Automation & Security

- Idle action / resume: after `pod.idle_timeout`, the container can pause (default action, keeps RAM) or stop (`pod.idle_action = "stop"`, frees RAM); the next launch resumes or cold-boots it
- Password auto-rotation: 20-char cryptographic password, 7-day cycle with rollback
- Smart DPI scaling: auto-detects from GNOME, KDE, Sway, Hyprland, Cinnamon, xrdb
- Multi-backend: Podman (default), Docker, manual RDP
- Windows build pinned to 11 25H2 (`TargetReleaseVersionInfo=25H2`, 365-day feature-update defer)
- Windows debloat: telemetry, ads, Cortana, DiagTrack, and SysMain are disabled by default; expanded presets can additionally disable OneDrive, widgets, scheduled tasks, startup programs, visual effects, search indexing, and transparency
- High-performance power plan + hibernation off + host-detected Windows timezone + Cloudflare DNS
- Time sync: force Windows clock resync after host sleep/wake
- FreeRDP `extra_flags` allowlist (regex-validated) as the user-input safety boundary

## Bare-metal disguise (VM-detection avoidance)

Shipped in v0.7.0. `balanced` is the default. Software that refuses to run when a hypervisor is detected — Nvidia GPU-passthrough "code 43", launch-gate VM checks, VM-hostile installers — sees a genuine-looking bare-metal box instead of QEMU/KVM. Select the level with:

```bash
winpodx config set pod.disguise_level off      # no disguise
winpodx config set pod.disguise_level balanced # default; per-VM hiding, container auto-recreated
winpodx config set pod.disguise_level max      # emulated hardware; requires wipe + reinstall
```

Or use the GUI Settings page → "Bare-metal level" selector (choosing Hardened triggers the image build and destructive reinstall confirmation automatically).

### Levels

**`balanced`** (per-VM, no patched-image rebuild):
- Clears the CPUID hypervisor-present bit and the KVM signature (`-cpu -hypervisor,kvm=off,-kvm-pv-*`)
- Mirrors the host's real SMBIOS/DMI (system / board / BIOS vendor + product, CPU vendor + model) into the guest
- Injects a synthetic SMBIOS sensor/descriptor blob (voltage / temperature probes, cooling device, cache, memory array + DIMMs, 40+ structures) so `Win32_*` / `CIM_*` WMI sensor classes report like real hardware

**`max` ("Hardened")** (includes everything in `balanced`, plus):
- `winpodx disguise build-image` compiles QEMU **locally** (~20–40 min) with the VM-identifying strings that can't be overridden via command line rewritten to the host's real values: ACPI OEM IDs (`BOCHS`/`BXPC` → host), FADT hypervisor-vendor + PM-profile byte, device `_HID`s, `WAET` table signature, disk / optical model **and INQUIRY vendor**; also injects a thermal-zone SSDT and a WSMT table
- Presents a SATA system disk, e1000 NIC, std VGA, and `nec-usb-xhci` USB-3 controller (keeps USB3 while dropping the Red Hat `VEN_1B36` tell); removes the virtio-rng device (`VEN_1AF4`) and prunes unused virtio driver service keys in the guest
- Requires `winpodx pod recreate --wipe-storage` when switching into or out of `max`, because changing the boot-disk controller makes the existing Windows install unbootable

No binary is ever shipped — the image is built on your machine from the standard QEMU source.

### Building the patched image

```bash
winpodx disguise build-image    # ~20–40 min on first build; cached after that
```

Or select "Hardened" in GUI Settings → Bare-metal level, which starts the build automatically.

### Privacy

The host-derived strings are *non-identifying* (vendor / model codes, like the disk model) and flow via Docker build-args into the **local image layer only — never committed to git, never pushed**. Serial / UUID / asset-tag are never read. The source ships generic fallbacks (`ALASKA` / `Samsung SSD` / `ATA`) so a build without host data is still valid.

### Verification

Verified against **al-khaser 0.82** on real Windows: the disk, sensor, SMBIOS, ACPI, CPUID, virtio-service, and username detection families read clean. Remaining tells are the container-QEMU structural floor (RDTSC timing, the legacy `Win32_MemoryDevice` class that is empty on real hardware too, and the Windows-inherent Hyper-V integration objects that share the RDP display driver).

## Windows disk auto-grow

The Windows `C:` drive grows itself as it fills, so you don't have to pre-provision a huge virtual disk or run out of space mid-install.

- **Auto-grow** runs only while the pod is idle, expands `C:` when it's nearly full, and is bounded by available host free space so it never overcommits the underlying storage. It correctly handles dockur's WinRE recovery partition that sits at the end of the disk.
- **Manual control**: `winpodx install grow-disk [SIZE|--extend-only]` to add space (or just extend the partition into existing free space), and `winpodx install disk-usage` to inspect current allocation.
- Config keys: `disk_autogrow*` (enable / thresholds / step) and `disk_max_size` (hard ceiling).

## Guest sync

Push host-side updates into a running Windows guest without reinstalling it. When WinPodX ships a newer guest agent, urlacl reservation, rdprrap build, or post-install fix, the guest picks it up in place.

- **Automatic** once per pod start when `guest_autosync` is enabled and the guest version stamp is older than the host.
- **Manual**: `winpodx guest sync [--force]` to reconcile on demand (`--force` re-pushes even when versions already match).

## App Profiles

App profiles are **metadata only**: they describe where a Windows app lives so WinPodX can launch it through FreeRDP RemoteApp. The actual Windows application must be installed inside the Windows container.

### Auto-discovery (default)

Starting from v0.1.9 WinPodX ships **no curated profile list**. The first time the Windows pod boots, the provisioner runs the same discovery path as `winpodx app refresh`. By default it scans:

- Start Menu `.lnk` recursion (depth-capped)
- Start-Menu-visible UWP / MSIX packages via `Get-AppxPackage` + `AppxManifest.xml`
- OS essentials that may not have a Start Menu shortcut

Set `desktop.full_app_scan = true` to additionally scan Registry `App Paths` (`HKLM` + `HKCU`), every UWP package, and Chocolatey + Scoop shims.

For each result it extracts the icon directly from the binary (or the package's logo asset for UWP) and writes the entry to `~/.local/share/winpodx/discovered/<slug>/`. Re-run any time:

```bash
winpodx app refresh        # CLI
# or click "Refresh Apps" on the GUI Applications page
```

### Adding a custom app profile manually

User-authored profiles live under `~/.local/share/winpodx/apps/` and override anything discovery finds with the same `name`:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/winpodx/apps/myapp
cat > ~/.local/share/winpodx/apps/myapp/app.toml << 'EOF'
name = "myapp"
full_name = "My Application"
executable = "C:\\Program Files\\MyApp\\myapp.exe"
categories = ["Utility"]
mime_types = []

[rdp]
scale = 125
multimon = "off"
extra_flags = "+multitouch"
EOF

winpodx app install myapp   # Register in desktop menu
```

## Multi-Session RDP

Stock Windows Desktop editions limit RDP to one session per user; a second app would otherwise reconnect and steal the first session. WinPodX bundles [rdprrap](https://github.com/kernalix7/rdprrap) — a Rust reimplementation of RDPWrap — inside the package itself and installs it automatically during the Windows unattended install, so each RemoteApp window gets its own independent session. The runtime limit is `cfg.pod.max_sessions` (default 25, range 1–50).

**RAIL prerequisites.** WinPodX applies `fDisabledAllowList=1` (enables RemoteApp publishing), `fInheritInitialProgram=1` (required for `/app:program:...` to launch the target executable instead of a shell), `fSingleSessionPerUser=0`, and `MaxInstanceCount` from `cfg.pod.max_sessions`. OEM setup initially writes a ceiling of 50; provisioning then synchronizes the configured value. These are set regardless of whether rdprrap installs successfully — rdprrap is what makes the sessions *independent*, but the registry keys are what make RemoteApp work at all. After rdprrap install `TermService` is cycled so the wrapper DLL activates without a reboot.

**Authentication channel.** NLA is disabled (`UserAuthentication=0`) so the FreeRDP command line can authenticate unattended from under `podman unshare --rootless-netns`, but `SecurityLayer=2` keeps the RDP channel itself encrypted with TLS (so `/sec:tls /cert:ignore` against `127.0.0.1` is the full authenticated + encrypted path — no cleartext on the wire even though NLA is off).

**Works fully offline.** The rdprrap zip ships inside WinPodX's data directory (`config/oem/`) and is staged into `C:\OEM\` during the guest's first boot. sha256 is verified against a pin file before extraction. No network access is required at install time.

The patch is applied during dockur's unattended setup phase. If anything in that step fails (hash mismatch, extraction, installer error), WinPodX logs a warning and the guest stays in single-session mode — app launch never blocks on this step. Manage it later with `winpodx guest multi-session on|off|status`; `winpodx guest apply-fixes` also self-heals activation.
