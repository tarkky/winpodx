"""btrfs Copy-on-Write detection and per-path disable helper.

dockur prints `Warning: you are using the BTRFS filesystem for /storage,
this might introduce issues with Windows Setup!` for a real reason: btrfs
defaults to Copy-on-Write on every block of every file, and a Windows VM
raw disk image has the worst possible access pattern for that — every
pagefile / swap / boot write forks a new extent. The disk image fragments
aggressively and grows past its declared size; pod recreates that should
take ~30 s on ext4 take many minutes (and often time out on the 300 s
budget). kernalix7 hit this on cachyos (#121, #122).

This module's helpers operate **only on paths the caller provides** —
typically the winpodx bind-mount storage directory
``~/.local/share/winpodx/storage``. We deliberately do NOT chattr the
container backend's graph root: that would silently flip every future
podman volume on the host to NoCoW, which is too broad and surprises
users who use btrfs snapshots (NoCoW files behave inconsistently across
snapshots).

Operations:

- :func:`detect_path_fs` — ``findmnt --target`` for any path; returns
  the filesystem type as a lowercase string (``btrfs``, ``ext4``, ...)
  or ``"unknown"`` when the binaries aren't installed or output can't
  be parsed.
- :func:`is_cow_disabled` — ``lsattr -d`` checks the ``C`` flag on the
  directory. Returns ``True`` / ``False`` / ``None`` (unknown).
- :func:`disable_cow_on_path` — runs ``chattr +C`` on the given path.
  ``chattr +C`` on a directory affects only NEW files created inside;
  existing files keep their previous CoW state. Idempotent — running
  on an already-NoCoW path short-circuits via :func:`is_cow_disabled`.

All helpers are best-effort: every external command is wrapped in
``try/except``, every failure surfaces as a status string to the
caller. We never abort the install on a btrfs detection or chattr
failure — the worst case is a slower pod, not a broken one.
