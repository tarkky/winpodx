"""System dependency checking.

Single source of truth for "is the host ready to run winpodx" probes. Every
caller (the setup wizard, the GUI Quick Start dialog, `winpodx doctor`, the
backend selector) should go through :func:`check_all` rather than reimplementing
its own ``shutil.which`` loop — that was the source of pre-0.6.0 drift, where
``deps_quickcheck.py`` and ``cli/doctor.py`` each carried a different (and
incomplete) list of FreeRDP binary names.

The shell side of ``install.sh`` keeps its own minimal pre-venv probe (it has
to run before Python is even installed); that's the single intentional shell
duplicate. Every other surface in the project consumes this module.
