r"""Execute PowerShell inside the Windows guest via FreeRDP RemoteApp.

Why this module exists
======================

``podman exec winpodx-windows ...`` runs inside the **Linux container**
that hosts QEMU, not in the **Windows VM** running inside QEMU. The
Linux container has no ``powershell.exe`` on $PATH, so any host-side
attempt to push registry / service / NIC changes via ``podman exec``
fails with rc=127. This bit v0.1.9.1, v0.1.9.2, and v0.1.9.3 — the
runtime apply functions appeared to succeed because they only logged
warnings on rc!=0 instead of raising. kernalix7 reported the silent-
fail symptom on 2026-04-26.

The reliable channel for actually-running-in-Windows commands is the
same RemoteApp launch path winpodx already uses to start Word, Excel,
etc.: launch ``powershell.exe`` as a RemoteApp via FreeRDP, have it
read its script body from the host-shared ``\\tsclient\home`` directory
(already mounted via ``+home-drive``), write its result back to that
same share, then exit so the RemoteApp window closes.

Cost
----

- ~5-10 seconds per call (RDP handshake + auth + script + disconnect).
- Brief PowerShell window flash unless the payload is wrapped in
  ``-WindowStyle Hidden`` (we do).
- Requires the configured RDP password to actually match the Windows
  guest's; if password rotation has been silently failing for months
  (which it has — same root cause: ``_change_windows_password`` also
  used podman exec), the first call here will fail with auth error and
  the user will need to manually sync.
