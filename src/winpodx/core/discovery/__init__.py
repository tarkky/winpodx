"""Dynamic discovery of installed Windows apps on the guest.

Invokes a guest-side PowerShell script (``scripts/windows/discover_apps.ps1``,
owned by platform-qa) which enumerates UWP/MSIX, Start Menu, and common
Win32 install locations and emits a JSON array on stdout. Results are
parsed into ``DiscoveredApp`` records and can be persisted under the
user data dir so they appear alongside bundled apps in the GUI and CLI.

Public API: ``scan(cfg)`` and ``persist(apps)`` are the explicit
entry points. Discovery is no longer auto-fired from
``provisioner.ensure_ready`` — a deliberate simplification per the
WINPODX redesign Step 3 (``feat/redesign``). Callers that want the
"discover on first install" UX (``install.sh``, the bundled
``winpodx app refresh`` post-install hook) call
``run_if_first_boot(cfg)`` explicitly.

    Pre-this-helper the classifier was a one-liner: any error whose
    message contained ``"no result file"`` or ``"auth"`` was tagged
    ``pod_not_running``. That over-fired on session-side failures
    where the pod was very much running -- e.g., FreeRDP RemoteApp
    succeeded at the connection layer but the guest's RDP session
    terminated mid-call (``ERRINFO_LOGOFF_BY_USER`` /
    ``ERRINFO_RPC_INITIATED_DISCONNECT``, both of which produce a
    "no result file written" outer message because the script never
    finished writing). The GUI then surfaced a "Pod Not Running"
    dialog on a perfectly running pod (kernalix7 hit this 2026-05-03
    after a fresh install).

    The new logic separates four states:

    1. ``pod_not_running`` — connection refused / connect transport
       failed / agent unavailable. Pod is genuinely down or still
       booting.
    2. ``session_disconnected`` — FreeRDP RemoteApp connected but
       the session terminated (LOGOFF_BY_USER, RPC_INITIATED_DISCONNECT,
       common during multi-session mid-activation). Retry usually
       works.
    3. ``timeout`` — the transport or guest command exceeded its deadline.

    Copies ``discover_apps.ps1`` into the running Windows container and

    absorb the script's first-boot readiness gate — up to 60 s waiting for
    AppXSvc + Start Menu .lnks — plus AppX enumeration on a low-spec guest).

    First-boot races (Sysprep just finished, AppX still deploying,
    Start Menu indexer mid-propagation) used to produce empty / partial
    results stochastically — kernalix7 reported (2026-05-02) menu
    populating one install and missing UWP entries the next on
    identical configs. Three layers now collapse the variance:

      1. Guest-side readiness gate (``discover_apps.ps1``) waits for
         AppXSvc Running + ProgramData Start Menu .lnk count > 0,
         requiring 3 consecutive stable 1 s samples before enumerating.
      2. Host-side transport readiness (this function, just below)
         waits for agent /health or RDP port to answer before invoking
         the script — covers the migrate-apply-chain race where
         TermService just cycled and the agent is mid-respawn.
      3. Host-side retry-on-empty (this function, after first run)
         retries once if the result is suspiciously empty (< 5 apps
         or 0 UWP — both impossible on a stock Win11 install).
