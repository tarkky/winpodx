    marker (pre-0.6.0); any positive value is an older but tagged schema.

    Today this is a no-op: 0.6.0 introduced the marker without changing the
    layout, so a 0.5.x file reads cleanly as schema 0 and is bumped to 1 on the
    next save with no key transforms. This function is the seam where future
    migrations land. Pattern::

        if from_version < 2:
            # 0.7.0: moved ``pod.idle_timeout`` to ``pod.idle.timeout_secs``.
            pod = data.setdefault("pod", {})
            if "idle_timeout" in pod:
                pod.setdefault("idle", {})["timeout_secs"] = pod.pop("idle_timeout")
        if from_version < 3:
            ...
        return data

    Each guarded block is idempotent so a migration that fails halfway and is
    re-run on the next load completes cleanly.
