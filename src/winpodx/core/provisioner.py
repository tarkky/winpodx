    This is the single source of truth for the ``wait-ready → agent-settle →
    apply-fixes → discovery → reverse-open`` sequence that previously lived,
    with subtly diverging ordering and gating, in ``install.sh``,
    ``setup_cmd._run_full_provision``, ``migrate``, and ``pending.resume``.
    It sits AFTER ``ensure_ready`` (which owns compose generation + pod
    bring-up + RDP recovery); ``finish_provisioning`` only consolidates the
    work each of those callers did once the pod was already running.

    Every stage is parameter-gated so the four callers can request exactly
    the behaviour they had before:

    * ``wait_timeout`` — seconds for ``wait_for_windows_responsive``.
      install.sh / setup_cmd use 3600; pending.resume uses 300.
    * ``require_agent`` — when True, hard-gate on the agent ``/health`` and
      raise :class:`ProvisionAgentUnavailable` if it never answers (migrate's
      behaviour — it refuses to fall back to FreeRDP RemoteApp because a
      fresh-boot FreeRDP connect can kick install.bat's autologon session).
      When False, do a best-effort settle poll (install.sh's behaviour:
      30 attempts × 2 s) and proceed silently regardless — this lets
      setup_cmd's auto-provision use the chain without crashing on a slow
      first boot.
    * ``with_discovery`` — run the shared discovery path (discover_apps +
      persist_discovered + _register_desktop_entries) with ``retries``
      attempts and exponential backoff. Defaults to 5 so transient channel
      and session failures on a heavily loaded first boot (Sysprep just
      finished, Defender scanning) can land on a progressively idler guest.
      A discovery deadline uses ``DEFAULT_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT`` and surfaces
      immediately instead of repeating an expensive operation on an already
      resource-constrained guest.
    * ``with_reverse_open`` — run the host-open listener-start + manifest
      refresh, gated additionally on ``cfg.reverse_open.enabled``.
    * ``on_progress(stage, detail)`` — optional callback so a GUI can mirror
      the same stages onto a progress bar without re-running the chain.
    * ``wait_fn(cfg, timeout) -> bool`` — optional override for the wait-ready
      stage. ``None`` (migrate / pending / GUI) runs the silent
      :func:`wait_for_windows_responsive`. The CLI ``provision`` command and
      the interactive setup wizard inject the rich log-streaming wait
      (``cli/pod._wait_ready`` — the ``[1/4]…[4/4]`` checkpoints, the
      self-erasing download/boot line, AND the wget-ETA dynamic deadline
      extension for slow links, #126) so a fresh install isn't a silent
      multi-minute hang. Injection (not import) keeps ``core`` cli-free. Must
      return True when the guest is ready, False on timeout/failure.

    With ``require_agent=True``, apply-fixes and discovery run under a
    task-local agent-only policy; no process environment is changed. Without
    propagation, discovery could still fall back to FreeRDP during first boot.

    """Shared discovery path: discover_apps → persist_discovered → register.

    This is the ONE discovery entrypoint the unified chain uses (0.6.0 item
    B). It is the more-complete of the two historical forms: it not only
    scans + persists but also installs the XDG .desktop entries AND prunes
    stale ones + refreshes the icon cache (via ``cli.app._register_desktop_
    entries``). install.sh's old ``app refresh`` and pending.resume's
    ``discover_apps + persist + register`` both collapse onto this.

    Retries non-timeout failures up to ``retries`` attempts with exponential
    backoff (2, 4, 8…s, capped at 30 s) to ride out the agent's transient
    "responsive but not yet stable" window right after install.bat's final
    TermService cycle. A timeout is terminal because immediately repeating a
    full-length scan compounds pressure on a resource-constrained guest.

    ``require_agent`` mirrors the chain-level flag: with ``WINPODX_REQUIRE_AGENT
    =1`` exported (which ``finish_provisioning`` does for the agent-first
    install path), ``discover_apps`` raises ``DiscoveryError(kind="agent_
    unavailable")`` instead of falling back to FreeRDP. When every attempt ends
    that way AND ``require_agent`` is set, we raise :class:`ProvisionAgent
    Unavailable` so the caller defers cleanly to the pending machinery (#271)
    rather than surfacing a generic discovery failure. Any other error (or the
    non-require-agent case) raises the last exception as before.

    The ``cli.app`` imports are lazy + local: discovery wiring (persist +
    desktop-entry registration) lives on the CLI side historically, and a
    module-level import here would invert the core→cli layering. The same
    lazy-import pattern is used by ``utils.pending.resume``.

    Multi-session is core winpodx functionality (the dialog "Select a

    it). Running it as a probe-only step (PR #77) was a safety measure
    against the inline-activation hang that mid-apply rdprrap-conf
    --enable caused: TermService restart killed the agent's session
    while the host was still awaiting /exec, /exec timed out, and the
    pod needed a full restart to recover.

    PR #80 made activation safe at runtime by spawning rdprrap-
    activate.ps1 *detached* via wscript+hidden-launcher.vbs. The /exec
    response returns before TermService cycles, so the host never
    blocks on a dying agent. Combined with the .activation_status
    marker for idempotency — already-enabled pods become a no-op,
    no disruption — this step now self-heals: if marker says enabled,
    return; otherwise queue the detached activator.

    Cost: when activation is needed, the user's RDP sessions briefly
    disconnect (~10 s) while TermService cycles. After reconnect, the
    marker reads ``enabled`` and subsequent applies are no-ops. This
    is the same one-time cost the OEM-time path pays, just deferred
    to migration time for users on pre-OEM-v15 builds.
