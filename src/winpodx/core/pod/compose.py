# Two storage-volume modes are now supported (v0.4.x post-#122):
#
#   1. Named volume (legacy default for users created before storage_path
#      existed). compose has a top-level `volumes:` section declaring
#      `winpodx-data:` and the service mounts it as `winpodx-data:/storage:Z`.
#      The Windows raw disk image lives at podman's graph-root volume path,
#      which on btrfs hosts inherits Copy-on-Write — the cause of #121,
#      #122. Existing users keep this mode until they explicitly run
#      `winpodx setup --migrate-storage`.
#
#   2. Bind mount (default for fresh installs). compose has NO top-level
#      `volumes:` section; the service mounts `<storage_path>:/storage:Z`
#      directly from a host-local directory winpodx owns
#      (`~/.local/share/winpodx/storage` by default). Setup applies
#      `chattr +C` on that directory before populating it, so the Windows
#      raw disk image inherits NoCoW from the parent directory at the
#      moment dockur first writes to it. Other podman workloads on the
#      same host are completely unaffected — the +C flag only touches
#      our specific directory.
#
# `_render_storage_blocks` chooses between the two based on
# `cfg.pod.storage_path`: empty → named volume, non-empty → bind mount.

    This replaces the older approach of injecting ``-cpu host,<sub-flags>``
    through ``ARGUMENTS``. dockur's ``proc.sh`` already exposes a
    ``CPU_FLAGS`` env var that gets appended to its own
    ``-cpu $CPU_MODEL,$CPU_FEATURES,$CPU_FLAGS`` assembly line, so the
    right place for our additions is that env var, not ARGUMENTS.

    Going through ``CPU_FLAGS`` avoids:

    * the ``proc.sh:137`` strip-and-slice bug -- if there's no
      ``-cpu host,...`` token in ARGUMENTS, the strip code path never
      runs, so the ``${args::-1}`` bash slice on an empty string never
      executes. The ``-msg timestamp=on`` marker workaround from #287
      is no longer needed.
    * duplication with dockur's Hyper-V enlightenments. dockur emits
      ``hv_passthrough`` (default ``HV=Y``) + a conditional
      ``-hv-evmcs`` when the host CPU can't actually nest. Our PR #281
      explicitly added ``hv-evmcs`` on top, which produced QEMU 10's
      ``Ambiguous CPU model string`` warning. dockur owns the hv-*
      set; we no longer touch it.

    Returns a comma-separated string of sub-flags suitable for the
    ``CPU_FLAGS:`` compose env. Empty string for aarch64 (dockur picks
    the right CPU on ARM hosts).

    Sub-flags we still emit:

    * ``arch_capabilities=off`` on x86 (#141 / #140 history -- Windows
      guest crashes when the Intel-only capability bits leak through).
    * ``+invtsc`` (#215) when the host CPU supports invariant TSC --
      not part of dockur's defaults, our addition.

    Sub-flags we now delegate to dockur:

    * ``hv-*`` enlightenments (HV=Y default)
    * ``hv-evmcs`` (conditional disable by dockur)
    * ``+vmx`` / ``+svm`` nested-virt (``VMX=Y`` env -- see

    Two regimes:

    1. **Bundle dir is user-writable** (curl install, source checkout,
       Nix profile install -- anything where the user owns the bundle
       tree). Return bundle path directly. No copy needed: Podman's
       ``:Z`` relabel works fine because the user owns the source.
       Avoids the parent-dir traversal problem ``~/.config/winpodx/``
       under umask 077 introduces -- dockur's in-container OEM-copy
       step runs as a non-root sub-UID that can't traverse a 0700
       ancestor (PR #95 / #266 / #267 history).

    2. **Bundle dir is read-only to current user** (RPM/wheel install
       under ``/usr/share/winpodx/`` -- root-owned, world-readable
       only). Copy the OEM tree into ``~/.config/winpodx/oem/`` and
       return that. Necessary because rootless Podman can't lsetxattr
       root-owned files for ``:Z`` (pgarciaq's GH-93). Files are
       chmod'd 0644 + dirs 0755 after copy so dockur's in-container
       ``cp`` can read regardless of the user's umask.

    #254's original P1 (timezone wiring) collapsed both regimes into a
    single always-copy path so we could drop ``timezone.txt`` next to
    the OEM scripts. That re-introduced the parent-dir traversal
    problem on hosts with a 0700 ``~/.config/winpodx/`` (#266 / #267
    user report). Switched to dockur's native ``TZ`` env var for
    timezone wiring instead, which means the OEM dir no longer needs
    per-config content -- so we can restore the two-regime layout.

    Falls back to the user OEM path string when the bundle OEM dir is
    missing (broken install), so callers still get a path for error
    messages.
