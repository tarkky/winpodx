"""Reverse-open listener — process incoming guest requests safely.

The Windows guest writes a JSON file per "Open with → <Linux app>"
click into a shared directory on the host's filesystem (the FreeRDP
drive redirect makes ``\\\\tsclient\\home\\...`` a regular mount on
Windows). The listener watches that directory and, for each new file,
parses + validates the request, resolves the path through Phase 1's
TOCTOU-safe :func:`~winpodx.reverse_open.paths.safe_open_unc`, and
spawns the registered Linux app with the file as a literal argv slot.

The design doc spells out the threat model in detail. The short
version:

- Guest is untrusted. Every input field gets validated before it
  reaches a syscall.
- ``app`` is a slug, matched against :class:`AppsDatabase`. The guest
  can't ask for an arbitrary binary -- only one of the apps the user
  staged via ``winpodx host-open refresh``.
- ``path`` is resolved through :func:`safe_open_unc`, which pins the
  inode in the listener's FD table before validating. A symlink swap
  after validation can't redirect the spawn target.
- Replay attempts are caught by :mod:`seen_uuids` (filename is the
  request UUID; the persistent ring buffer rejects duplicates across
  process restarts).
- Request files larger than ``max_request_bytes`` (64 KB default) are
  refused without parse. JSON depth is capped at
  ``max_request_depth`` (8) to defend against parser-exhaustion
  attacks.
- Stale files (age > ``janitor_age_seconds``, default 300) are removed
  during the periodic sweep so a guest that wrote a request while the
  listener was down doesn't trigger a stale spawn on the next start.
- The ``incoming/`` directory itself must be owned by the listener's
  euid and not group/world-writable; the listener refuses to start
  otherwise.

The current implementation uses a 500 ms polling loop (``os.scandir``)
rather than inotify. Polling is portable to non-Linux test runners,
avoids an external dependency, and is fast enough for the
human-driven event rate this feature has. The 60 s reconciliation
sweep mentioned in the design doc is still part of the loop — it now
serves as the janitor trigger.

See ``docs/design/REVERSE_OPEN_DESIGN.md`` §"Component contracts →
listener.py" and §"Security threat model".
