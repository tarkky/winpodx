"""Reverse-open feature configuration schema.

Persisted under ``[reverse_open]`` in ``winpodx.toml`` alongside the
existing ``[rdp]`` and ``[pod]`` sections. The defaults are tuned so
that simply pulling this module into the load path is *invisible* to
existing users — :attr:`ReverseOpenConfig.enabled` is ``False`` until
the user explicitly opts in via ``winpodx host-open enable`` (or the
GUI Settings card in phase 4). See ``docs/design/REVERSE_OPEN_DESIGN.md``
section "Component contracts → config.py" for the full contract.

The dataclass deliberately avoids raising in :meth:`__post_init__`:
this layer sits between an untrusted-by-default file (the user's TOML
on disk, hand-editable) and a feature that ends up forking
subprocesses on the host. A malformed slug, a wrongly-typed list, or
a corrupt ISO-8601 string must coerce to a safe default, not crash
``Config.load``. Any guarantees the rest of the codebase relies on
(slug regex, list-of-string typing, ISO-8601 round-trippability) are
enforced *here*, before the values reach
:mod:`winpodx.reverse_open.listener` or the CLI.

# verbatim into a Windows registry key name (``winpodx-<slug>.exe``)
# and into a JSON request from the guest. Anything outside this set
# would either break the registry write or open a smuggling avenue
# for malformed input from a hand-edited TOML.

    """Persisted state for the reverse file-association feature.

    Fields:

    - ``enabled``: master toggle. Defaults to ``False`` so a winpodx
      upgrade adds this section silently — no behaviour change for
      existing installs. Flipped via ``winpodx host-open enable``.
    - ``allowlist``: explicit slugs the user has whitelisted. Empty
      list means "all discovered apps" (subject to the denylist).
    - ``denylist``: explicit slugs to suppress. Combined with the
      ``DANGEROUS_DEFAULTS`` set when ``deny_dangerous=True``.
    - ``last_synced_at``: ISO-8601 timestamp of the last successful
      host-to-guest sync. Used for the staleness warning ("last
      synced 4 h ago") and to drive auto-refresh on pod start when
      it's older than 24 h.
    - ``deny_dangerous``: when True (default), the
      :attr:`DANGEROUS_DEFAULTS` slugs are folded into the effective
      denylist on each load. Users who want one of those apps
      surfaced anyway can either flip ``deny_dangerous=False`` or
      leave the default and explicitly remove the slug from
      ``denylist`` after loading (the explicit-remove path is wiped
      on next ``__post_init__``, so the proper escape hatch is the
      master toggle — documented in the design doc).
