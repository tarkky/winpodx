"""UNC -> POSIX path translation for incoming reverse-open requests.

Mirror of ``core.rdp.linux_to_unc``. The Windows guest's shim writes
each request with the path as the guest sees it -- typically a UNC
path through the FreeRDP drive redirect (e.g.
``\\\\tsclient\\home\\kernalix7\\Documents\\foo.xml``). Before we hand
the path to the spawned Linux app, we have to:

1. Map it back to the Linux-side ``/home/kernalix7/Documents/foo.xml``.
2. Verify it's actually under a directory we know we shared with the
   guest.
3. Defend against the TOCTOU window between resolution and spawn --
   a malicious guest can swap a symlink between the two.

The atomic context manager :func:`safe_open_unc` is the *only* correct
entry point for callers that will hand the resulting path to a child
process: it opens the FD before validation, then validates against
the kernel's authoritative ``/proc/self/fd/N`` readlink, so the
*validation* cannot be redirected by a later on-disk swap.

What the FD pins is the listener's own view. A caller that passes
``real_path`` into a child's argv makes that child reopen **by name**,
which is racy again; such callers must call
:meth:`SafeFile.assert_unchanged` immediately before spawning to
re-check the name against the pinned inode. Only ``proc_path`` with
``pass_fds`` (or an FD-backed portal pathname) removes the race
outright.

The display-only helper :func:`translate_unc_to_posix` remains for
log/error messages and CLI status lines. It is **not** TOCTOU-safe;
the window between its return and the caller's open-or-spawn is
unguarded, so the result must never be passed to ``subprocess.Popen``
or any other open()-by-name primitive. Use :func:`safe_open_unc`
instead.

Security: this module is the trust boundary between guest-supplied
input and host-side execution. Refuses paths that:

- Aren't under one of the share roots active in the current
  ``RDPConfig.drives`` (caller passes the live mapping).
- Resolve via ``..`` or symlink to outside that root.
- Land under ``/proc``, ``/sys``, or ``/dev`` after resolution.
- Are empty, contain NUL, or aren't strings.
- Carry a non-ASCII share name (Windows shares are ASCII; non-ASCII
  is either a misconfiguration or an obfuscation attempt).

If ``share_roots`` is empty, every input is refused -- no shares
configured means no legal target exists.

Limitations:

- **Hard links**: ``Path.resolve()`` doesn't see them. A guest-side
  hard-link of a privileged file into ``~`` would only succeed if
  the user already has read access to the file, so the blast radius
  is bounded -- but audit logs will be confusing. Mitigation belongs
  in the file-format apps (the ones that actually parse the data),
  not at this layer.

The functions are total: every input either returns / yields a valid
result under a share root or raises ``ReversePathError`` with a
reason. Callers should ALWAYS treat a raise as a security event and
log at WARNING -- a guest shim trying to write a path outside the
share is either misconfigured or actively malicious.

    the kernel's authoritative view of the inode is what's validated.

    Sequence:

    1. Parse the UNC path into an unresolved candidate via
       :func:`_unc_to_candidate` (prefix-strip, share-root mapping,
       character validation -- no resolve, no denylist yet).
    2. Open the candidate immediately with ``O_PATH | O_NOFOLLOW``.
       From this point on the kernel pins the inode the FD points at,
       even if the on-disk path is swapped to a different inode.
    3. Read the kernel's authoritative resolved path via
       ``os.readlink('/proc/self/fd/N')`` -- this is the canonical
       path to the inode the FD references, regardless of any later
       symlink swap.
    4. Validate that readlink result against the matched share root
       (also resolved via ``Path.resolve(strict=False)``) using
       :func:`is_relative_to`.
    5. Apply the post-resolve denylist (``/proc``, ``/sys``, ``/dev``)
       to the readlink result.
    6. On any validation failure, close the FD and raise
       :class:`ReversePathError`.
    7. On success, yield a :class:`SafeFile` whose ``proc_path``
       (``/proc/self/fd/N``) is safe to pass to ``subprocess.Popen``
       (with ``pass_fds=(self.fd,)``).
    8. Close the FD on context exit (success or exception).
