"""``winpodx doctor`` -- diagnose common winpodx state issues (#255 PR 6).

Read-only diagnostic. Walks a small set of checks for things that
commonly leave users stuck (half-installed state, orphan containers,
stale autostart entries, broken deps) and prints a per-check report
with a severity tag and the suggested next command.

Output format mirrors ``apt`` / ``brew doctor``:

    [OK]   freerdp 3.x present at /usr/bin/xfreerdp3
    [WARN] tray autostart entry references missing binary
           Suggested: winpodx uninstall && winpodx setup
    [FAIL] container winpodx-windows exists but config is missing
           Suggested: winpodx uninstall --purge --yes

By default doctor never mutates state -- the suggested commands are
printed for the user to copy. With ``--fix`` doctor additionally runs an
idempotent auto-remediation for every finding that carries a known fixer
(see ``_FIXERS``), then re-probes that single check and reports whether it
is now ``fixed`` or ``still failing``. Findings with no registered fixer
are reported as "no auto-fix available". Each fixer is a no-op when the
underlying state is already healthy.

Exit codes:
    0 -- no FAIL findings (warnings may be present)
    1 -- one or more FAIL findings

Designed to be cheap (< 2 s on a healthy install): every subprocess
probe has a short timeout, and the network never gets touched.
