"""Post-upgrade migration wizard for winpodx.

Invoked automatically by ``install.sh`` when an existing winpodx
installation is detected, or manually via ``winpodx migrate``. Shows
version-specific release notes for versions the user has skipped over
and optionally triggers app discovery so the new dynamic-discovery
feature (v0.1.8+) populates the menu immediately.

Version tracking lives in ``~/.config/winpodx/installed_version.txt``.
The first install after v0.1.8 writes that file; earlier installs had
no tracker, so a missing file combined with an existing
``winpodx.toml`` is treated as a pre-tracker upgrade (baseline 0.1.7).

    """Auto-migrate `winpodx-data` named volume to a NoCoW bind mount on btrfs.

    Hook: runs at the tail of `winpodx migrate`, after the apply chain
    has settled the existing guest. Conditions for triggering:

    - cfg.pod.backend in {podman, docker}
    - cfg.pod.storage_path is empty (= legacy named-volume mode, hasn't
      been migrated yet)
    - the `winpodx-data` named volume actually exists
    - its mountpoint is on btrfs

    When all four hold, we run the same migration path as
    `winpodx setup --migrate-storage` (stop pod → chattr +C empty
    target → rsync → persist storage_path → remove old volume →
    restart). Interactive runs prompt for confirmation (default Yes);
    non-interactive runs (install.sh post-upgrade) auto-execute, since
    the user is already on btrfs in a degraded state and the whole
    point of running migrate is to apply fixes.

    Best-effort: any failure leaves the named volume intact (the
    migration code preserves the source until copy succeeds), so
    interrupted migrations don't lose Windows.
