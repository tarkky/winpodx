# because the marker would block tray spawn far longer than we want
# (uninstall is expected to be short, and leaving a stale marker would
# leak into the next install / GUI session). Every ``winpodx`` CLI call
# this script makes (host-open stop-listener, unregister-guest, etc.)
# inherits the env, so ``maybe_spawn_tray`` short-circuits cleanly --

# winpodx uninstaller -- single source of truth for every install channel.
#
# Usage:
#   ./uninstall.sh                # Interactive: asks before each step, keeps container + config
#   ./uninstall.sh --yes          # Non-interactive: auto-yes, keeps container + config
#   ./uninstall.sh --purge        # Non-interactive: full wipe (container, volumes, config)
#   ./uninstall.sh --purge --yes  # Same as --purge (purge implies --yes)
#
# One-liner (curl | bash):
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kernalix7/winpodx/main/uninstall.sh | bash -s -- --yes
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kernalix7/winpodx/main/uninstall.sh | bash -s -- --purge
#
#   --yes or --purge is required when piping -- interactive prompts cannot
#   read from a terminal while bash is consuming stdin from curl.
#
# Internal flag (set by package post-remove hooks, not for end users):
#   --from-postrm   Re-entered from a deb/rpm/aur postrm hook. Skips the
#                   install-source detect step (avoids re-exec'ing the
#                   package manager that's already removing us) and skips
#                   reverse-open daemon calls (the winpodx binary may
#                   already be gone at this point).
#
# Env overrides (for non-default deployments; rarely needed):
#   WINPODX_CONTAINER_NAME   default: winpodx-windows
#   WINPODX_STORAGE_PATH     default: ~/.local/share/winpodx/storage
#   WINPODX_BACKEND          default: auto-detect (podman > docker)
